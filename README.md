# Discord Menubar App

This is a project of mine that i'm currently working on as i'm learning JavaScript.

Discord MenuBar app is an idea I came up with to have a discord menu of some sort on the menubar
instead of going back and forth on the application. I want include notification and voice chat
settings for easy access.

This seems to be a difficult project but i'll be grateful for any help I get.
